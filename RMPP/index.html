								<a id="unit_1"><h4>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This module began by introducing the concept of academic research and, most importantly, underscoring the importance of ethics in the field. Many reading assignments in this unit identified the distinction between ethics and morality, which has helped me understand my own position. Though ethics are critical to the respect and discipline in our field, I feel that morality has a special place in the decision-making process and ultimately determines how well I’ll sleep at night. As I read about scientific investigation and research, the equities of ethics and morality were generally aligned. However, when reading about conducting offensive cyber operations to disable predatory networks, ethics and morality certainly clashed.</p>

								<a id="unit_2"><h4>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h4></a>
							</header>

							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week introduced literature reviews and research proposals. Though I have read hundreds of literature reviews over the years, I have never produced one – so I enjoyed taking a moment to understand the underlying methodology and degree of labour required. Similarly, I have written scores of business proposals over the years, but never a research proposal. As with other types of proposals, I learned that research proposals must clearly describe your goal, the means by which you will achieve that goal, and why your approach will work. This has reinforced my appreciation for creative approaches to problem solving – research, or otherwise – and the use of effective communication to obtain audience buy-in.</p>
							<ul>

								<a id="unit_3"><h4>Unit 3: Research Methods</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This was one of my favourite units throughout my MSc programme. Research design allows me to figure out how to solve a research problem, using different modalities to learn about a problem. This week’s reading assignments reinforced my notion that research methods offer different ways of collecting and synthesising information from data, with each method bringing its own strengths and weaknesses. I learned that combining research methodologies produces a multi-dimensional perspective of a problem, and ultimately delivers more meaningful and accurate results. I believe that research design is an art as much as it is a science, and benefits from a holistic understanding of the problem.</p>

								<a id="unit_4"><h4>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>: During Unit 4, I learned about different observation methods to conduct primary research. For my literature review, I have decided to research the application of machine learning in music recommender systems (MRS); specifically, I want to determine if the use of MRS impacts the musical preferences of its users. I believe that many of the observation methods discussed in this week – such as focus groups and case studies – may be prone to bias through subjective interpretations and anecdotal evidence. The more I learn about music preference formation, the more I see a need to isolate subjective variables and create apples-to-apples quantitative comparisons. Furthermore, it seems that many studies in this field may inadvertently impact the results – so discreet observation will be important.</p>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_5"><h4>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>For as long as I can remember, I have enjoyed figuring out how to get information from people (note – that sounds more sinister than intended!). The reading and activities during this week revisited the importance of ethics in survey design and resultant data usage, and how seemingly innocuous interactions with questionnaires may end up providing information for purposes beyond the respondent’s awareness. This is a clear violation of research ethics. In further reading, I realised that the handling of research data is just as important as ethically conducting research in the first place.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the “Interviews and Survey Design” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Completed Reflective Activity 2 - Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts/Reflective%20Activity%202.pdf" target="_blank">link to Reflective Activity 2</a>).</li>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_6"><h4>Unit 6: Questionnaire Design</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this unit, I learned about conscious and unconscious bias, and how to develop questions that improve the objectivity, measurement, and analysis of responses. Before this unit, I believed that asking open-ended questions was not particularly useful to research due to the inherent variance in response possibilities; however, it appears that qualitative analysis techniques can make use of this variance to discern valuable insights. While I gravitate toward quantitative analysis, and finding ways to constrain qualitative analysis, the use of open-ended questions is a technique I hope to explore in future research problems.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the “Questionnaire Design” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Focussed on the completion of the summative Literature Review assignment.</li>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_7"><h4>Unit 7: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This unit taught me how to establish credibility in research efforts through reliability, generalisability, and validity. After reflecting upon this week’s reading assignments and activities, I believe that transparency in research is critical to the scientific community, as well as the greater public. Research must be trusted in order to be useful. I also appreciate that researchers may interpret results differently, or infer different conclusions; however, the underlying experiment methodology should be sound. After reading hundreds of research papers for my literature review, I have learned to appreciate that debate in the scientific community is healthy and benefits the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Validity and Generalisability in Research” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Posted an Initial Post for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts/RMPP%20Collab%20Discussion%202.pdf" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>

								<a id="unit_8"><h4>Unit 8: Inferential Statistics</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>As a computer science graduate student, statistics are vitally important to my field of study. This week refreshed my knowledge on how to apply inferential statistics to research populations, and how to ensure that quantitative measurements are conducted in a standardised manner recognised by the scientific community. I also expanded my knowledge on the use of descriptive statistics to describe research results, which I will incorporate into my Research Presentation assignment. I grew up thinking of problems and results in terms of numbers: this unit has reintroduced concepts that will help me better communicate analytical methodologies and research findings in the future.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the “Summary Measures and Inference” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Researched and drafted response posts to classmates for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts/RMPP%20Collab%20Discussion%202.pdf" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>

								<li>Listened to the Seminar 4 Zoom recording.</li>
							</ul>
												
							<header>
								<a id="unit_9"><h4>Unit 9: Analysing Qualitative Data</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>I have always found qualitative analysis to be a difficult methodology to master due to its subjectivity. However, it often unlocks the story behind quantitative results. This week helped refine my qualitative analysis skills by introducing frameworks and approaches to standardise qualitative responses into usable data. I also learned techniques to minimise variance in the interpretation of qualitative results, mitigating some of the difficulties I have previously faced with this research methodology. This unit also gave me insight into many of the business research surveys I have participated in over the years.</p>

								<a id="unit_10"><h4>Unit 10: Research Writing</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 10 has been very useful in the context of my professional career. One of my primary activities is to propose the implementation of novel technologies and technical solutions to prospective clients. I take pride in my ability to communicate; however, I have noticed that my communication style resonates more with military and operational audiences than academic circles. I believe that the writing techniques learned in this week will not only help me with my impending dissertation but will improve my ability to communicate with researchers. This week also gave me a better idea of what to expect in the final Project module for my dissertation.</p>

								<a id="unit_11"><h4>Unit 11: Professional Development – Your e-Portfolio</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week gave me an opportunity to reflect upon my course work through the duration of my studies at the University of Essex. I still have a distance to go before completing my degree programme, but seeing that I am weeks away from completing my coursework and beginning my dissertation is motivating! This course has been a fantastic preparation for my capstone by giving me the requisite skills to succeed, and an idea of what to expect in the months ahead.</p>

								<a id="unit_12"><h4>Unit 12: Project Management and Managing Risk</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>As I’m currently taking the Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM) course in parallel with this course, this week discussed topics I’ve been reviewing for the past several months. However, it inspired me to consider how I will apply project management to my dissertation. Developing a project plan will help me stay on schedule and ensure that my artefacts are organised and logical.</p>
