								<a id="unit_1"><h4>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This module began by introducing the concept of academic research and, most importantly, underscoring the importance of ethics in the field. Many reading assignments in this unit identified the distinction between ethics and morality, which has helped me understand my own position. Though ethics are critical to the respect and discipline in our field, I feel that morality has a special place in the decision-making process and ultimately determines how well I’ll sleep at night. As I read about scientific investigation and research, the equities of ethics and morality were generally aligned. However, when reading about conducting offensive cyber operations to disable predatory networks, ethics and morality certainly clashed.</p>

								<a id="unit_2"><h4>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h4></a>
							</header>

							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week introduced literature reviews and research proposals. Though I have read hundreds of literature reviews over the years, I have never produced one – so I enjoyed taking a moment to understand the underlying methodology and degree of labour required. Similarly, I have written scores of business proposals over the years, but never a research proposal. As with other types of proposals, I learned that research proposals must clearly describe your goal, the means by which you will achieve that goal, and why your approach will work. This has reinforced my appreciation for creative approaches to problem solving – research, or otherwise – and the use of effective communication to obtain audience buy-in.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal” Lecturecast.</li>

							<hr />

							<header>
								<a id="unit_3"><h4>Unit 3: Research Methods</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This was one of my favourite units throughout my MSc programme. Research design allows me to figure out how to solve a research problem, using different modalities to learn about a problem. This week’s reading assignments reinforced my notion that research methods offer different ways of collecting and synthesising information from data, with each method bringing its own strengths and weaknesses. I learned that combining research methodologies produces a multi-dimensional perspective of a problem, and ultimately delivers more meaningful and accurate results. I believe that research design is an art as much as it is a science, and benefits from a holistic understanding of the problem.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Submitted a Summary Post for Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 1</a>).</li>

							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_4"><h4>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>: During Unit 4, I learned about different observation methods to conduct primary research. For my literature review, I have decided to research the application of machine learning in music recommender systems (MRS); specifically, I want to determine if the use of MRS impacts the musical preferences of its users. I believe that many of the observation methods discussed in this week – such as focus groups and case studies – may be prone to bias through subjective interpretations and anecdotal evidence. The more I learn about music preference formation, the more I see a need to isolate subjective variables and create apples-to-apples quantitative comparisons. Furthermore, it seems that many studies in this field may inadvertently impact the results – so discreet observation will be important.</p>

								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Literature Review Outline (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Literature Review Outline</a>).</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 3.</li>

							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_5"><h4>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>For as long as I can remember, I have enjoyed figuring out how to get information from people (note – that sounds more sinister than intended!). The reading and activities during this week revisited the importance of ethics in survey design and resultant data usage, and how seemingly innocuous interactions with questionnaires may end up providing information for purposes beyond the respondent’s awareness. This is a clear violation of research ethics. In further reading, I realised that the handling of research data is just as important as ethically conducting research in the first place.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the “Interviews and Survey Design” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Completed Reflective Activity 2 - Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Reflective Activity 2</a>).</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_6"><h4>Unit 6: Questionnaire Design</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this unit, I learned about conscious and unconscious bias, and how to develop questions that improve the objectivity, measurement, and analysis of responses. Before this unit, I believed that asking open-ended questions was not particularly useful to research due to the inherent variance in response possibilities; however, it appears that qualitative analysis techniques can make use of this variance to discern valuable insights. While I gravitate toward quantitative analysis, and finding ways to constrain qualitative analysis, the use of open-ended questions is a technique I hope to explore in future research problems.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the “Questionnaire Design” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Completed the “Questionnaires” Wiki Activity (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Wiki Activity</a>).</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_7"><h4>Unit 7: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This unit taught me how to establish credibility in research efforts through reliability, generalisability, and validity. After reflecting upon this week’s reading assignments and activities, I believe that transparency in research is critical to the scientific community, as well as the greater public. Research must be trusted in order to be useful. I also appreciate that researchers may interpret results differently, or infer different conclusions; however, the underlying experiment methodology should be sound. After reading hundreds of research papers for my literature review, I have learned to appreciate that debate in the scientific community is healthy and benefits the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Validity and Generalisability in Research” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Posted an Initial Post for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed and submitted the Literature Review assignment (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Literature Review assignment</a>).</li>
							</ul>

								<a id="unit_8"><h4>Unit 8: Python Data Structures</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During Unit 8, I reviewed Python data structures as they apply to advanced technologies such as internet-of-things, automation technology, and sensors. We examined which Python data structures would be most appropriate the application our group is developing for our Presentation assignment. During this week, the team managed to complete the primary requirements for the development project, and I was able to learn extensively from Alberto and Djordje as they debugged issues with one of our application’s menu features. We also realised that three requirements would have to be pushed to the following release.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Conducted Seminar 4 preparation activities.</li>
								<li>Reviewed progress and planned final activities for the Presentation assignment.</li>
								<li>Performed functional testing for completed application features.</li>
								<li>Tested application compatibility with different environments.</li>
								<li>Finalised the presentation outline and components.</li>
							</ul>
												
							<header>
								<a id="unit_9"><h4>Unit 9: Quality Management Strategy</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 9 introduced the concept of quality as a process throughout all phases of software engineering project management. Whilst I was familiar with the incorporation of quality assurance and quality control, using quality planning as a means of preventing technical debt was a novel concept. As I learned with testing, incorporating quality management throughout all phases of the SDLC should be a deliberate process that ultimately benefits project cost, schedule, and customer satisfaction. This week’s reading also gave me quality management metrics that I can apply to my current projects.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Quality Management Strategy” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Completed the “Improving Code Quality” e-Portfolio Activity (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Improving Code Quality activity</a>).</li>
								<li>Participated in the weekly group meeting and developed materials for the Presentation assignment.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_10"><h4>Unit 10: Software Quality Monitoring in Python</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>My knowledge of Python has steadily increased from module to module. Unit 10 revisited linters as a best practice to analyse code quality, which I have used extensively throughout my studies. This week, I learned how to incorporate linters through GitHub actions as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, courtesy of teammate Marianne. It was impressive to see how CI/CD pipelines can quickly and efficiently ascertain the quality and security of code, and something I intend to use in my future development projects.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Finished presentation slides and talking points, recorded presentations.</li>
								<li>Planned final activities for the Presentation assignment during the weekly team meeting.</li>
								<li>Completed the “Using Linters to Achieve Python Code Quality” Codio activity.</li>
								<li>Watched the Seminar 5 Zoom recording.</li>
							</ul>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_11"><h4>Unit 11: Software Engineering Project Management - Future Trends</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This was a busy week for the module, as we put the final touches on our Presentation assignment for submission. It was interesting to learn about future trends in software engineering project management, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Operations, or AIOps, which may emerge as the next evolution of Development Operations (DevOps). I will expand my knowledge in this area following this course, as my current clients would benefit greatly from the increased automation AIOps brings to the enterprise. I also learned about the next generation of languages emerging, and the additional security measures they incorporate; I have already begun to investigate the Rust language.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>•	Completed the “Future Trends” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>•	Finalised the video production and performed testing for the Presentation assignment.</li>
								<li>•	Conducted a final Presentation review on our weekly team meeting.</li>
								<li>•	Submitted the Presentation assignment and Peer Review (<a href="https://youtu.be/QjXFkpM8unI" target="_blank">link to Presentation on YouTube</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SEPM-Nov-2022/sepm-rc-car" target="_blank">link to GitHub repository</a>).</li>

								<a id="unit_12"><h4>Unit 12: The Case for the Future Direction of Software Engineering Project Management</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week built upon the emerging software engineering trends introduced in Unit 11. Our group discussed the likelihood of each trend to significantly impact the field of study; however, each of these was overshadowed by the recent proliferation of ChatGPT and the emerging field of language training model AI platforms, and how they may be used to generate and assess the quality of code. Though the hype around these technologies is deafening, along with a general failure to understand how the technology works, the case for using ChatGPT to assist software development is undeniable. Just ask it.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 6: Future Trends in SEPM (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Seminar 6 preparation</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed end-of-module Reflective assignment (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Reflective Assignment</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed and submitted the SEPM e-Portfolio</li>
								<li>Submitted the end-of-module survey.</li>
