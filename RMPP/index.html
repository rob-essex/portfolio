								<a id="unit_1"><h4>Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week marked the beginning of the Software Engineering Project Management module. Since I’ve spent more than 15 years managing projects, many of the initial concepts of the course are familiar. However, I have not focussed on managing software engineering projects; whilst concepts such as the software development lifecycle and agile development are familiar, I had not yet encountered The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). This unit filled in some of my knowledge gaps regarding software engineering efforts. This module is also centred around group work, which has proven to be incredibly challenging in a remote environment – but also, something I have come to truly enjoy.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management.”</li>
								<li>Researched failures in project management and submitted an initial post for Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 1</a>)</li>
								<li>Prepared for group assignments and coordinated an introductory team meeting.</li>
								<li>Developed our team contract for group activities.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_2"><h4>Unit 2: Study: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this unit, I learned more about the requirements process and how to apply Gherkin for requirements development and testing. Whilst I have previously used user stories to elicit and refine requirements from users, I had never encountered Gherkin. Being able to test requirements programmatically through Cucumber was fascinating, and something I can keep in my arsenal for future projects. Its structured format and machine readability make Gherkin/Cucumber a good option for scaling systems and keeping track of evolving requirements.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Developed requirements in Gherkin to prepare for Seminar 1 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Gherkin example</a>).</li>
								<li>Listened and participated in Seminar 1, Project Failures Study.</li>
								<li>Responded to classmate posts in Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 1</a>).</li>
								<li>Began weekly team meetings for group assignments and began identifying a project concept for our summative assignments.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />

							<header>
								<a id="unit_3"><h4>Unit 3: Estimating, Planning and Risk</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>"Risk" is a concept central to my career over the past 20 years. This began with my military service, when risk was initially measured in lives lost and political humiliation. Puzzlingly, those concerns felt simpler than managing my present-day risks such as project performance, corporate growth, and profit-and-loss. This unit introduced frameworks and concepts to minimise risk from inadequate resource estimation, which repeatedly emerges as a top cause for project failure. I will be able to apply these techniques to my current portfolio and future contracts.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the “Estimating, planning, and risk” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Posted a Summary Post for Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 1</a>).</li>
								<li>Drafted recommendations for our team’s Project Report activity.</li>
								<li>•Participated in the weekly team meeting to discuss the Project Report requirements and necessary tasks.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_4"><h4>Unit 4: Risk Assessment and Estimating Tools</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 4 built on Unit 3 by introducing different risk elements and potential mitigation strategies. I learned about enterprise-wide risk management programs; admittedly, this phrase is not new to me, and I had previously dismissed it as a fusion of paranoia and bloated bureaucracy. Perhaps begrudgingly, I have realised that effective enterprise risk management is vital to successful client delivery and corporate development.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 2 with Activities 1 and 2 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Seminar 2 Preparation</a>).</li>
								<li>Listened to Seminar 2 Zoom recording.</li>
								<li>Developed and assessed requirements for the Project Report summative assignment.</li>
								<li>Shared status on the Project Report and plan follow-on tasks during the weekly team meeting.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_5"><h4>Unit 5: User Experience</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>User Experience (UX) is a field that has always fascinated me, especially as a user. This unit showed me how far the field has come in the past few years, with more attention and resources dedicated to UX efforts throughout the entire project lifecycle. Though UX ultimately relies upon the fundamental concept of delivering user requirements, it is enlightening to see how user behaviour is increasingly considered from requirements gathering through post-implementation evaluation. I had previously associated “UX” with “UI,” under the false impression that UX was predominantly aesthetic. However, I believe that effective UX has more in common with behavioural science than software development. Further, UX can help advocate for user equities during the development phase.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “User Experience” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Authored an initial post for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/Codio_Activities.html" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>
								<li>Reviewed the team’s Project Report assignment and updated the sprint plan.</li>
								<li>Discussed outstanding tasks and final steps for the Project Report during the weekly team meeting.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_6"><h4>Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Over my years of casual programming and exposure to different coding tools, I had never encountered tools known as “linters.” This unit oriented me to linters, and I will certainly incorporate them in my future development efforts going forward. Not only do they improve the quality of code, but linters also help me increase my knowledge of the programming language by identifying an issue (such as an unnecessary “else” statement), pointing me to the location of the issue, and enabling me to check to see if my remedy is effective. During this week, our team also finalised our design document prior to submission.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team Meeting: review combined work product, identify final actions for design assignment </li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 3 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/Codio_Activities.html" target="_blank">link to Codio activities</a>)</li>
								<li>Completed and submitted the Development Team Project: Design Document (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/First4Aid_Design_Doc.pdf" target="_blank">link to design document</a>)</li>
								<li>Completed and submitted the Peer Review for the Design Document assignment</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_7"><h4>Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>As an avid computer user for more than three decades, I have used a variety of operating systems beginning with Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS), Unix, and the subsequent incarnations of Windows. I currently use Mac OS X, Windows 11, and Linux on a daily basis. Despite my familiarity with operating systems of all shapes and sizes, this unit filled in some of my foundational knowledge gaps about kernels, processes, and how operating systems are designed (or not designed) to provide security at the foundational level.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “Operating System Security”</li>
								<li>Responded to the “What is an Ontology?” assignment (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U7-Ontologies.html" target="_blank">link to ontology</a>)</li>
								<li>Completed Codio activities: Exploring a simple Python shell, Developing an API for a Distributed Environment (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/Codio_Activities.html" target="_blank">link to Codio activities</a>)</li>
							</ul>
						
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_8"><h4>Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this week’s lesson, I learned about the application of cryptography via operating systems and Python libraries. Discovering TrueCrypt’s encryption capabilities, questionable origins, and controversial abandonment drove me to investigate other publicly available encryption software. This unit provided a very timely and relevant introduction to Python cryptography libraries, as this will be a cornerstone for our team’s web application. In addition to Python’s existing cryptography library, I researched other options such as BCrypt, PyJWT, and Pycryptodome.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: discussed progress and plan to continue secure application development</li>
								<li>Researched and authored a post for Collaborative Discussion 2 about the TrueCrypt case study (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2 and ontology</a>)</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 4 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8_Seminar_4_Prep.html" target="_blank">link to questions</a>)</li>
							</ul>
												
							<header>
								<a id="unit_9"><h4>Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been a topic of personal interest for quite some time. Over the past several years, I have been trying to work with a poorly formed ATOM feed to build a dataset for a machine learning application. This unit taught me some of the API fundamentals I have been missing, and after this course concludes, I am excited to revisit that project. During this week, I also learned more about the Flask framework, building templates using Jinja2 and HTML, and incorporating Object Relational Mapping (ORM) modules such as SQLAlchemy into web applications. Our team has been working very hard on developing our web application this week.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: assessed application progress, reprioritised development actions</li>
								<li>Provided feedback to classmates’ posts for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2 and ontology</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_10"><h4>Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This unit taught me about the variety and evolution of system architectures. This has been particularly informative since many of the topics du jour – microservice architectures, distributed computing, and containerisation – continue to proliferate in professional fora. This has coincided with the implementation of our team’s application architecture. With the application’s modular components tested and assembled, we have been focussed on moving the components into Docker. This will enable us to run our application in a containerised environment, while simultaneously achieving a microservice architecture between the Flask/HTML front end interface, Python application, and the PostgreSQL back end.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: finalised application development and planned our demonstration</li>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures"</li>
								<li>Reviewed feedback and created a summary post for Collaborative Discussion 2 about the TrueCrypt case study (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2 and ontology</a>)</li>
								<li>Completed the Faceted Data activity (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U10-Faceted_Data.html" target="_blank">link to activity</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_11"><h4>Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this week, our team spent a LOT of time working to finalise our secure web application before the demonstration, testing scenarios, and working through our development backlog to implement new features whilst addressing bugs. We had rolling code reviews throughout the week, two coordination sessions to build and rehearse our presentation, and two more sessions to finalise our code and documentation for submission. I believe our demonstration went well; however, as is the case with all demonstrations, we had a bug on one of our functions because I failed to commit one of the last bug fixes to our repo! Despite this frustration, our team carried on and didn’t let this glitch derail the rest of our briefing. This was a difficult week – but a rewarding one.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: Prepared for, and rehearsed, our demonstration brief</li>
								<li>Team meeting: finalised web application documentation and submission requirements</li>
								<li>Demonstrated Team Least Privilege’s First4Aid web application (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/First4Aid_Demo_Brief.pdf" target="_blank">link to demonstration brief</a>)</li>
								<li>Finalised and submitted the documentation and code for the First4Aid web application (<a href="https://github.com/Least-Privilege-Team/first4aid_final" target="_blank">link to First4Aid repo</a>)</li>
								<li>Reflected upon the differences from the First4Aid Design Document to the Final Coding Output (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U11-First4Aid_Reflection.html" target="_blank">link to First4Aid reflections</a>)</li>
							</ul>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_12"><h4>Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Due to the time spent on our secure application assignment during Unit 11, this week was a bit of a catch-up. I read about the microservices and microkernels dispute and discussed some of these concepts with our team to formulate a response to the debate. As a proud Linux user, I have come to enjoy the speed and efficiency of that operating system; however, I certainly see the merits for a microkernel architecture. Personally, I believe that the benefits of consolidation and distribution are dependent on the technological application: will the impending era of quantum computing breathe new life into monolithic kernels?</p>
							<p>I have spent a lot of time reflecting upon this course – not only for the sake of my reflective assignment, but because this has been the most engrossing and challenging module to date. Through the long hours, myriad frustrations getting WTForms and SQLAlchemy to cooperate, and gut-wrenching realisation that failures in application development are only the fault of the developer, I was part of a talented team who ceaselessly supported each other.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “Future Trends”</li>
								<li>Completed the e-Portfolio compilation, components, and web design</li>
								<li>Completed the final module reflective writing assignment (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/Final_Reflective_Assignment.pdf" target="_blank">link to reflective writing assignment</a>)</li>
						  	  <li>Participated in Microkernel Debate (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U11-Microkernel_Debate.html" target="_blank">link to debate position</a>)</li>
