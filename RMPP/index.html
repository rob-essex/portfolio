								<a id="unit_1"><h4>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This module began by introducing the concept of academic research and, most importantly, underscoring the importance of ethics in the field. Many reading assignments in this unit identified the distinction between ethics and morality, which has helped me understand my own position. Though ethics are critical to the respect and discipline in our field, I feel that morality has a special place in the decision-making process and ultimately determines how well I’ll sleep at night. As I read about scientific investigation and research, the equities of ethics and morality were generally aligned. However, when reading about conducting offensive cyber operations to disable predatory networks, ethics and morality certainly clashed.</p>

								<a id="unit_2"><h4>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h4></a>
							</header>

							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week introduced literature reviews and research proposals. Though I have read hundreds of literature reviews over the years, I have never produced one – so I enjoyed taking a moment to understand the underlying methodology and degree of labour required. Similarly, I have written scores of business proposals over the years, but never a research proposal. As with other types of proposals, I learned that research proposals must clearly describe your goal, the means by which you will achieve that goal, and why your approach will work. This has reinforced my appreciation for creative approaches to problem solving – research, or otherwise – and the use of effective communication to obtain audience buy-in.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Read and responded to classmates’ posts for Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 1</a>).</li>

							</ul>
							<hr />

							<header>
								<a id="unit_3"><h4>Unit 3: Research Methods</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This was one of my favourite units throughout my MSc programme. Research design allows me to figure out how to solve a research problem, using different modalities to learn about a problem. This week’s reading assignments reinforced my notion that research methods offer different ways of collecting and synthesising information from data, with each method bringing its own strengths and weaknesses. I learned that combining research methodologies produces a multi-dimensional perspective of a problem, and ultimately delivers more meaningful and accurate results. I believe that research design is an art as much as it is a science, and benefits from a holistic understanding of the problem.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Submitted a Summary Post for Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 1</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed the Research Proposal Review e-Portfolio activity (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Research Proposal Review activity</a>).</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 2.</li>
								<li>Listened to the Seminar 2 Zoom recording.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_4"><h4>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>: During Unit 4, I learned about different observation methods to conduct primary research. For my literature review, I have decided to research the application of machine learning in music recommender systems (MRS); specifically, I want to determine if the use of MRS impacts the musical preferences of its users. I believe that many of the observation methods discussed in this week – such as focus groups and case studies – may be prone to bias through subjective interpretations and anecdotal evidence. The more I learn about music preference formation, the more I see a need to isolate subjective variables and create apples-to-apples quantitative comparisons. Furthermore, it seems that many studies in this field may inadvertently impact the results – so discreet observation will be important.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Literature Review Outline (<a href="../RMPP/Artefacts" target="_blank">link to Literature Review Outline</a>).</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 3.</li>

							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_5"><h4>Unit 5: User Experience</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>User Experience (UX) is a field that has always fascinated me, especially as a user. This unit showed me how far the field has come in the past few years, with more attention and resources dedicated to UX efforts throughout the entire project lifecycle. Though UX ultimately relies upon the fundamental concept of delivering user requirements, it is enlightening to see how user behaviour is increasingly considered from requirements gathering through post-implementation evaluation. I had previously associated “UX” with “UI,” under the false impression that UX was predominantly aesthetic. However, I believe that effective UX has more in common with behavioural science than software development. Further, UX can help advocate for user equities during the development phase.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “User Experience” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Authored an initial post for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>
								<li>Reviewed the team’s Project Report assignment and updated the sprint plan.</li>
								<li>Discussed outstanding tasks and final steps for the Project Report during the weekly team meeting.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_6"><h4>Unit 6: pytest and Test-Driven Development</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 6 introduced Test-Driven Development (TDD), a development methodology I had never personally encountered. Admittedly, automated testing has been a weakness of mine; throughout my development projects, I have always produced custom tests making extensive use of the print function to see what was happening in the program and to debug errors. This week gave me more exposure to additional automated testing concepts, additional exposure to pytest, and showed me how testing can be used to advance development instead of occurring as a perfunctory afterthought.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the pytest Codio activity.</li>
								<li>Submitted the Project Report assignment and Peer Review (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Project Report assignment</a>).</li>
								<li>Provided feedback to peers during Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>
								<li>Scheduled a team meeting to prepare for the Presentation assignment.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_7"><h4>Unit 7: Software Development Life Cycles</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week revisited many common concepts discussed earlier in this module, and throughout the MSc educational programme, in the context of the software development life cycle (SDLC). This unit tied many concepts together and helped me enumerate and evaluate the many SDLCs in practice today. Though Agile is the preferred approach for most contemporary projects, it’s useful to see how predictive SDLCs can help structure and guide development efforts. I am particularly interested in combining these SDLCs as appropriate, having witnessed successful hybrid Agile/waterfall and Agile/Scrum/Kanban SDLCs in recent years.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Software Development Life Cycles” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Posted a Summary Post for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Collaborative Discussion 2</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed the Unit 7 e-Portfolio activity  (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/First4Aid_Design_Doc.pdf" target="_blank">link to design document</a>)</li>
								<li>Proposed an outline for the Presentation assignment during the weekly team meeting.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_8"><h4>Unit 8: Python Data Structures</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During Unit 8, I reviewed Python data structures as they apply to advanced technologies such as internet-of-things, automation technology, and sensors. We examined which Python data structures would be most appropriate the application our group is developing for our Presentation assignment. During this week, the team managed to complete the primary requirements for the development project, and I was able to learn extensively from Alberto and Djordje as they debugged issues with one of our application’s menu features. We also realised that three requirements would have to be pushed to the following release.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Conducted Seminar 4 preparation activities.</li>
								<li>Reviewed progress and planned final activities for the Presentation assignment.</li>
								<li>Performed functional testing for completed application features.</li>
								<li>Tested application compatibility with different environments.</li>
								<li>Finalised the presentation outline and components.</li>
							</ul>
												
							<header>
								<a id="unit_9"><h4>Unit 9: Quality Management Strategy</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 9 introduced the concept of quality as a process throughout all phases of software engineering project management. Whilst I was familiar with the incorporation of quality assurance and quality control, using quality planning as a means of preventing technical debt was a novel concept. As I learned with testing, incorporating quality management throughout all phases of the SDLC should be a deliberate process that ultimately benefits project cost, schedule, and customer satisfaction. This week’s reading also gave me quality management metrics that I can apply to my current projects.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Listened to the “Quality Management Strategy” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>Completed the “Improving Code Quality” e-Portfolio Activity (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Improving Code Quality activity</a>).</li>
								<li>Participated in the weekly group meeting and developed materials for the Presentation assignment.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_10"><h4>Unit 10: Software Quality Monitoring in Python</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>My knowledge of Python has steadily increased from module to module. Unit 10 revisited linters as a best practice to analyse code quality, which I have used extensively throughout my studies. This week, I learned how to incorporate linters through GitHub actions as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, courtesy of teammate Marianne. It was impressive to see how CI/CD pipelines can quickly and efficiently ascertain the quality and security of code, and something I intend to use in my future development projects.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Finished presentation slides and talking points, recorded presentations.</li>
								<li>Planned final activities for the Presentation assignment during the weekly team meeting.</li>
								<li>Completed the “Using Linters to Achieve Python Code Quality” Codio activity.</li>
								<li>Watched the Seminar 5 Zoom recording.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_11"><h4>Unit 11: Software Engineering Project Management - Future Trends</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This was a busy week for the module, as we put the final touches on our Presentation assignment for submission. It was interesting to learn about future trends in software engineering project management, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Operations, or AIOps, which may emerge as the next evolution of Development Operations (DevOps). I will expand my knowledge in this area following this course, as my current clients would benefit greatly from the increased automation AIOps brings to the enterprise. I also learned about the next generation of languages emerging, and the additional security measures they incorporate; I have already begun to investigate the Rust language.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>•	Completed the “Future Trends” Lecturecast.</li>
								<li>•	Finalised the video production and performed testing for the Presentation assignment.</li>
								<li>•	Conducted a final Presentation review on our weekly team meeting.</li>
								<li>•	Submitted the Presentation assignment and Peer Review (<a href="https://youtu.be/QjXFkpM8unI" target="_blank">link to Presentation on YouTube</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SEPM-Nov-2022/sepm-rc-car" target="_blank">link to GitHub repository</a>).</li>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_12"><h4>Unit 12: The Case for the Future Direction of Software Engineering Project Management</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week built upon the emerging software engineering trends introduced in Unit 11. Our group discussed the likelihood of each trend to significantly impact the field of study; however, each of these was overshadowed by the recent proliferation of ChatGPT and the emerging field of language training model AI platforms, and how they may be used to generate and assess the quality of code. Though the hype around these technologies is deafening, along with a general failure to understand how the technology works, the case for using ChatGPT to assist software development is undeniable. Just ask it.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 6: Future Trends in SEPM (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Seminar 6 preparation</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed end-of-module Reflective assignment (<a href="../SEPM/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Reflective Assignment</a>).</li>
								<li>Completed and submitted the SEPM e-Portfolio</li>
								<li>Submitted the end-of-module survey.</li>
