								<a id="unit_1"><h4>Unit 1: Introduction to Information Systems</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week, I learned about the foundations of Information systems, and what can go wrong with information systems when poorly designed or tested.  I also became acquainted with the Systems Development Lifecycle, which validated the processes I’ve witnessed in the technology industry.</p>
							<ul><i>Activities Performed:</i>
						<li>Researched and authored a post for Collaborative Discussion 1 about a system failure that almost caused a nuclear war (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U1-3_Collab_Discussion_1.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 1</a>)  </li> </ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_2"><h4>Unit 2: Information Systems and their Importance</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>In Unit 2, I continued learning about information systems in business environments, components of information systems, and catastrophic failures.  Of particular interest, I read the Agile Manifesto and learned about IT project management techniques.  This has increased my understanding of how, and why, we manage projects using Agile and Scrum frameworks at work.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Responded to colleagues’ Collaborative Discussion 1 posts about systems failures (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U2_Collab_Discussion_1_Peer_Responses.html" target="_blank">link to responses</a>)</li>
								<li>Read and evaluated feedback from peers on my initial post (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U1-3_Collab_Discussion_1.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 1</a>)</li>
									<li>Listened to the Seminar on the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />

							<header>
								<a id="unit_3"><h4>Unit 3: Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>In Unit 3, I was introduced to the fundamentals of object-oriented design, and how this programming construct seeks to emulate objects and interactions in the physical world.  I learned the core principles of object-oriented programming in Python through Codio activities.  I also learned standardised practices for designing object-oriented information systems through the Supermarket Class Diagram activity, which was my first proper (albeit, infantile!) step toward system design.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Consolidated my initial post and peer responses into a summary post for Collaborative Discussion 1 (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U1-3_Collab_Discussion_1.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 1</a>)</li>
								<li>Codio activities: Classes &amp; Objects, Class Functions and Methods, Inheritance</li>
								<li>Created a Supermarket Class Diagram (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U3_Supermarket_Class_Diagram.html" target="_blank">link to supermarket class diagram)</a></li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_4"><h4>Unit 4: Object-Oriented Development and Python</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week, I expanded upon the principles and concepts unique to object-oriented programming such as polymorphism and encapsulation.  Through reading assignments, Codio, and independent research, I learned how to apply these concepts in Python.  Codio effectively walked me through these techniques, which – as a hands-on learner – cemented the lessons from the reading assignments.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Codio activities: Classes &amp; Objects, Class Functions and Methods, Inheritance</li>
								<li>Listened to the Seminar on Working with UML</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_5"><h4>Unit 5: Understanding UML</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week’s introduction to Unified Modelling Language (UML) and its different uses was incredibly useful and directly beneficial to my design and prototyping work.  I have learned how to map use cases, classes, and interactions between system components in standardised formats recognised across the software industry.  As a self-educated technologist, this has greatly enhanced my ability to communicate technical concepts with teams.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Updated the Supermarket Class Diagram with UML conventions (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U5_Supermarket_Class_Diagram.html" target="_blank">link to UML class diagram</a>)</li>
								<li>Researched and tested UML design applications: SmartDraw, draw.io, Lucidchart</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_6"><h4>Unit 6: Hands-on with UML</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>In Unit 6, I continued learning about UML features.  Most importantly, I learned how to use Python to code the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships I was drawing.  Whilst I still have a lot to learn about code elegance and finding the most efficient ways to replicate object-oriented design, I feel confident in the underlying principles of implementing class diagrams.  This week’s seminar preparation activities – building a UML class diagram, sequence diagram, and activity diagram for a surgery – also reinforced the many perspectives of development UML can address.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Seminar preparation: surgery UML class diagram, appointment UML sequence diagram, appointment activity diagram (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U6_Surgery_Diagrams.html" target="_blank">link to UML diagrams</a>)</li>
								<li>Listened to the Seminar on Python Programming</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_7"><h4>Unit 7: Database Design</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week, I learned about the normal forms of database design, ensuring data integrity whilst eliminating data redundancy.  The Unit 7 Lecturecast and reading assignments informed me about using primary and foreign keys to prevent data duplication reinforces the integrity of data sets.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Third Normal Form (3NF) Table Structure Diagram (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U7_3NF_Model.html" target="_blank">link to table structure diagram</a>)</li>
								<li>Mid-Module Assignment: System Design (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/Unit 7 - Mid-Module Assignment - System Design.pdf" target="_blank">link to system design assignment</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>Evaluation of the System Design Assignment</h5>
							<p>My first summative assignment, building a UML class diagram for a supermarket, allowed me to combine my business experience with new concepts from this course.  My design applied object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, aggregation, and composition to create a system design that efficiently achieved all the required objectives.  Dr. Buckley provided positive feedback, indicating that my approach used a variety of appropriate techniques, was comprehensive, and easy to understand.</p>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_8"><h4>Unit 8: Hands-on with Database Design</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 8 has reinforced my knowledge about databases; since I have been working extensively with relational databases for decades, it was useful to read through the fundamentals of database design.  I also delved into Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), a construct that I have been using for years without understanding how they represent the “normal forms” of data.  As it happens, the table structure I did for Unit 7 was already an ERD!</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Researched and authored a post for Collaborative Discussion 2 about graph databases (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2</a>)</li>
								<li>Third Normal Form (3NF) ERD (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U8_ERD_Diagram.html" target="_blank">link to ERD</a>)</li>
								<li>Listened to the Seminar on Database Design</li>
							</ul>
												
							<header>
								<a id="unit_9"><h4>Unit 9: Implementing Databases with SQL</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week greatly expanded my knowledge about NoSQL databases, which continue to proliferate due to their ability to handle massive amounts of data.  Whilst I have been familiar with NoSQL databases for a number of years, this unit gave me a true understanding of the breadth of NoSQL database types available, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and how they operate under the hood.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Responded to colleagues’ Collaborative Discussion 2 posts about NoSQL technologies (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U9_Collab_Discussion_2_Peer_Responses.html" target="_blank">link to responses</a>)</li>
								<li>Read and evaluated feedback from peers on my initial post (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_10"><h4>Unit 10: Working with SQL</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 10 refreshed my knowledge of basic SQL through Codio exercises.  I spent time reading responses from my colleagues on the collaborative discussion about NoSQL, and found several technologies that I will explore further, such as MongoDB.  I also researched different tools to help with coding Python, SQL, and Flask for the System Implementation summative assignment due at the end of Unit 11.  After trying several Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), I ended up selecting PyCharm – which gives free licences to students!</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Consolidated my initial post and peer responses into a summary post for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2</a>)</li>
								<li>Codio activities: Introduction to SQL, Advanced SQL, Advanced Topics in Object Oriented Programming</li>
								<li>Listened to the Seminar on System Implementation</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_11"><h4>Unit 11: Web Development in Python</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This unit was the first time I realised that I could develop a useful web application – something that I have been aspiring to do for many years.  I still have a lot to learn before I achieve that goal, but understanding how Python, SQL, and the Flask framework work together to capture, collect, and manipulate data to create dynamic web content was enlightening.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Codio activity: Introduction to Flask</li>
								<li>Listened to the Seminar on E-portfolio Submission</li>
								<li>Assignment: System Implementation (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/Unit 11 - Assignment - System Implementation.pdf" target="_blank">link to System Implementation narrative</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rob-essex/oois_system_implementation" target="_blank">link to GitHub repo</a>)</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>Evaluation of the System Implementation Assignment</h5>
							<p>This assignment was my first time implementing a system design in code, and it was invaluable.  Most of the classes, attributes, and methods were relatively straightforward; however, some aspects of the design were vague and required creativity to achieve.  This was also my first time creating automated test scripts for a system instead of building single-use manual tests.  I spent many days working on this assignment, and I could have spent many more – I still think of other things I wish I would have documented, explained, or streamlined!

								<a id="unit_12"><h4>Unit 12: The Future of Information Systems</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 12 provided me with additional context about the current and future states of information systems.  Many of the topics covered in the reading – privacy, cyber security, ethics, and globalization – encompass most of the headlines in the news, today.  In response to the blog assignment, I researched edge computing and identified it as the next significant evolution of the cloud – enabling lower cost and lower latency for exponentially increasing applications.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Blog Post: Emerging Trends (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U12_Blog_Emerging_Trends.html" target="_blank">link to Emerging Trends Blog</a>)</li>
								<li>End-of-Module Reflective Writing Assignment (<a href="../OOIS/Artefacts/U12 Reflective Writing Assignment.pdf" target="_blank">link to Reflection</a>)</li>
								<li>Post-Module Review</li>
								<li>Submission of e-Portfolio</li>
