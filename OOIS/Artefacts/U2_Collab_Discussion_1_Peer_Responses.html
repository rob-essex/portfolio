<p>Roberto, this is a great example of how governments often fail to properly design, develop, and implement information systems. According to a study conducted by the Brookings Institution, government information technology (IT) projects are prone to failure due to four main factors: large project size, legacy system requirements, multiple stakeholders with divergent requirements, and lack of business incentives for successful IT project implementation (Yaraghi, 2015). These factors often sabotage government IT projects before they even begin, as revealed in a report from The Standish Group stating that only 6.4 percent of government IT projects with a value greater than $10 million were successful (Yaraghi, 2015). A report from the Harvard Business Review also indicates that the waterfall system design method brings its own set of vulnerabilities, particularly when it comes to testing on complex IT projects (McGrath, 2008). Implementing an iterative development approach, such as Agile Scrum, may have allowed sufficient testing and prevented the payment errors for 78,000 Queensland Health staff (McGrath, 2008; Moore, 2013). Furthermore, financial damage may have been mitigated by funding the developer, IBM, incrementally by milestones and objectives instead of a blanket percentage of the contract value (McGrath, 2008; Moore, 2013). As government IT projects continue to proliferate and mature, organizations will need to establish effective governance structures to identify and mitigate risks throughout the system development lifecycle (Alsheri &amp; Drew, 2011; McGrath, 2008; Yaraghi, 2015).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maja, as someone who particularly enjoys Walkers on occasion, I appreciate your post. Like you, I have been unable to find a credible source detailing the precise problem Walkers faced with their system upgrade. The additional articles I read seem to indicate that the issue impacted the system responsible for the actual crisp production and packaging, since shops had noted a severe decrease in the number of products delivered and presumably contacted Walkers (Day, 2021; Pegden &amp; Hanlon 2021; The Guardian, 2021). This was likely a problem with the factory’s supervisory control and data acquisition – or SCADA – system, which incorporates the software and hardware required to execute industrial processes such as manufacturing (Process Solutions Inc., 2019). SCADA systems are often highly complex, deal with myriad legacy system components, and each factory configuration is unique (Yardley, 2008). This means that SCADA systems have to be tailored – or in some cases, built from the ground up – for each application, which creates more potential for problems to arise (Yardley, 2008). Based on current trends with SCADA system upgrades, Walkers may have been upgrading their manufacturing system to “Industry 4.0” standards, incorporating internet-of-things (IoT) technology to increase automation, control, and analysis functions (Liagkou et al, 2021). These same technologies also power the life-sustaining systems across the globe, from insulin pumps to nuclear power stations – so improving the design, implementation, operation, and security of SCADA systems is vital to our existence as we know it (Yardley, 2008).
