	<p>I used an application called SmartDraw <a href="www.smartdraw.com">(www.smartdraw.com)</a> for my updated class diagram.  However, later in the course, I switched to Lucidchart <a href="www.lucidchart.com">(www.lucidchart.com)</a>.  SmartDraw symbols are slightly different than most of the UML references I have found (e.g., SmartDraw uses filled arrows to show inheritance, though most UML resources indicate that this should be an empty/hollow arrow).  Lucidchart also gives users more control over where and how lines intersect, which made it easier for me to design UML diagrams later in the class.</p>
