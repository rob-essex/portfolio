<p>Throughout my career, I have come to appreciate the unique properties of graph databases – particularly, their ability to reveal patterns and relationships within data. Graphs are comprised of nodes, which represent entities, and edges, which are the links between each node (Clark, 2019; Patil et al, 2014). The combination of two nodes and an edge between them is collectively referred to as a relationship (Paul, 2019).</p>
<p>Graph databases are incredibly useful for finding patterns within complex datasets, especially traditional relational databases with lots of many-to-many relationships (Paul, 2019). For example, graph databases can be used to identify illicit networks within financial systems (Kurshan et al, 2021; Tiwari, 2021). By ingesting data into a graph, entities – such as companies, individuals, IP addresses, phone numbers, web domains, and bank accounts – can be quickly linked to each other (Kurshan et al, 2021; Tiwari, 2021). Even individuals who hide behind many layers of shell corporations, pseudonyms, and business associates are still connected to original transactions, even if there are additional nodes and edges in between. This is referred to as the distance, or path, between nodes, and implies a relationship between each node in the path (Paul, 2019). These nodes and paths of interest form sub-graphs, networks within networks that can be further investigated and exploited to learn more about the illicit actors and activities (Kurshan et al, 2021).</p>
<p>Colleague Andrea Paolo Gussoni observed that graph databases are particularly useful for social media analysis through the use of associated user profiles, common attributes, and other types of metadata (Gussoni 2022; Patil et al, 2014).</p>
<p>Colleague Wang Wang noted that while graph databases are immensely powerful, they currently lack standardisation (Wang, 2022). This inhibits the ability for users and developers to migrate data between graphs, and requires a bespoke solution for each application (Wang, 2022). &nbsp;</p>
