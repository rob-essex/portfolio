<i><h2>Edge Computing: Evolution of the Cloud</h2></i></center>
<body>
<p>Cloud computing – centralising resources to enable scaled and efficient processing capabilities – fundamentally changed the course of information system development over the past twenty years (Satyanarayanan, 2017). This evolution has proliferated access to massive computing power through daily interactions with search engines, the Internet of Things (IoT), and digital assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana (Gill et al., 2020; Hoy, 2018; Pratt, 2021).</p>
<p>The evolution of technologies first enabled by the cloud has produced the need for computational resources closer to the end-user to reduce cost and latency (Gill et al., 2020; Hoy, 2018; Pratt, 2021). Cloud computing has become increasingly expensive as more devices connect to the internet and produce exponentially more data (Pratt, 2021). Furthermore, the adoption of technologies such as augmented reality, autonomous transportation, and health monitoring sensors has increased the demand for faster data processing and response (Gill et al., 2020). Establishing smaller compute resources, called cloudlets, micro data centres, or fog nodes, has pushed data processing power closer to the supported devices and applications at the “edge” of the internet (Satyanarayanan, 2017; Gill et al., 2020). The emergence of edge computing has allowed greater performance and economy by handling time-sensitive tasks over comparatively short distances between users and edge compute resources, and slower tasks over longer distances from the edge to cloud compute resources (Gill et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Edge computing also brings other benefits from further decentralisation of the internet. The global development community uses edge computing to expand access to internet resources in regions with unreliable internet access (Schmida et al., 2017). When combined with mobile wide area networks, edge computing has been a pivotal resource for establishing communications and supporting recovery efforts for natural disasters (Novakouski &amp; Lewis, 2021). On the battlefield, soldiers now possess additional edge computing capabilities that enable them to rapidly analyse and assess swathes of data from the growing myriad of sensors charged with collecting vital information (Novakouski &amp; Lewis, 2021).</p>
<p>As the world generates more data, edge computing distributes processing throughout our global infrastructure to increase speed, availability, and cost-effectiveness of processing resources.</p>
