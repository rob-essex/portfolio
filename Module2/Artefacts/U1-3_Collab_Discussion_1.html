<h2>Summary Post</h2></center>

<p>Of interest to the current geopolitical stand-off  between Russia and the West, nuclear missile detection systems for both the  United States and Soviet Union experienced errors which produced false alarms  during the Cold War (Stevens &amp; Mele, 2018). A series of false alarms  occurred on 3 June 1980, when a defective integrated microchip caused the  number “2” to replace some zeros in the data field storing the number of  missiles detected (National Security Archive, 2020).  As a result, the North American Aerospace  Defense Command (NORAD) reported that 2,200 missiles were heading toward the  United States (Stevens &amp; Mele, 2018).   Worse yet, this alert occurred shortly after the Soviet Union had  invaded Afghanistan, so the U.S. was already hyper-vigilant for Soviet  aggression (Schlosser, 2016). The American National Security Advisor, Zbigniew  Brzezinski, received a phone call just before 2:30am, who in turn initiated  nuclear response protocols: preparing to evacuate the President, launching airborne  command centres, and readying Minuteman nuclear-armed missiles for retaliatory  strikes (Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, 2019). Thankfully, Brezezinski received  a call within minutes stating that this was a false alarm – missile warning  sensors did not corroborate the report, and retaliatory measures were cancelled  minutes before the U.S. would have launched missiles against the Soviet Union  (National Security Archive, 2020).</p>

Expounding on this point, Wang Wang noted that data  accuracy within a system should not solely rely on a single fallible data  source – particularly when the implications of inaccuracy jeopardise lives  (2022). This pattern of reliance upon a single data source was also observed in  the Boeing 737 MAX failures (Wang, 2022).</p>
	
<p>Further, Mohammad  Atieh commented that system testing should be conducted in accordance with the  likelihood of a given system error, and more importantly, the subsequent  consequences if such an error were to occur (2022).</p><br>
