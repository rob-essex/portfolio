<p>Andrea, thank you for your review of MongoDB. I have also come across this database management system frequently throughout my studies, and it is highly prevalent in the technology industry. This type of NoSQL underpins many of the companies and services we depend on, today, such as online shopping through eBay, managing real estate sales for Keller Williams, and online gaming with Electronic Arts (Mongo DB, Inc., 2022).</p>
<p>Though NoSQL databases are not designed to perform the same functions in the same manner as relational databases, increasing demand for managing massive amounts of non-uniform data has fueled the growth of storage technologies such as MongoDB (Krishnan et al, 2016). Furthermore, MongoDB is significantly more efficient than relational databases, and even some other NoSQL databases systems, when handling massive amounts of data (Krishnan et al, 2016). In addition to performance gains, this also reduces costs (Krishnan et al, 2016).</p>
<p>One of the other benefits of MongoDB, compared to other NoSQL solutions such as Cassandra, is that the BSON records are self-describing and do not need a separate schema, since the field names and data are both stored in the record (Rowe, 2019).</p>
<p>Thank you for the primer on MongoDB, you encouraged me to learn more about this database technology!</p>
<p>Rob</p>

<p>Maja, thank you for discussing NoSQL databases. This family of database technologies has been fascinating to me for years!</p>
<p>The exponential growth of data certainly necessitated a more efficient solution to manage such massive volumes of data, and in that regard, I certainly agree with your statement that relational databases have become obsolete (Tagt, 2022). Through my research, I have found that relational databases do retain some advantages over NoSQL in certain situations (Bitnine.net, 2016; Pandora FMS Team, 2016). SQL databases are largely standardized, using a single uniform language for development and operations (Bitnine.net, 2016). Additionally, data must adhere to integrity standards pre-defined by SQLâ€™s schema (Pandora FMS Team, 2016). Thus, when working with datasets with known data points and a defined number of records, SQL databases may still be the better choice in terms of cost, compatibility, and ease of use (Bitnine.net, 2016; Pandora FMS Team, 2016).</p>
<p>Due to the explosion of data volume the world has experienced in the past several years, NoSQL technologies have continued to become more prominent to manage an increasingly unmanageable amount of data (Krishnan, 2016). Despite the weaknesses associated with some of these databases technologies, I believe that continued implementation and innovation will continue to improve the standardization, security, and ease of use in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you for your thought-provoking post!</p>
<p>Rob</p>
