								<a id="unit_1"><h4>Introduction to Secure Software Development</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week, I reviewed common management approaches to software development, focussing on waterfall and agile software development lifecycles. As a practitioner in the technology field, these weren’t new concepts – however, reviewing them laid the groundwork for follow-on discussions about Unified Modelling Language (UML) models. Whilst I became familiar with UML during the Object-Oriented Information Systems module, additional exposure and application of UML during Unit 1 increased my knowledge and expertise with this critically important skillset. Learning UML has significantly improved my ability to communicate software designs across development teams. During this unit, I became oriented with the Online Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Reviewing the OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities helped me learn what to look for when assessing application security.</p>
							<ul><i>Activities Performed:</i>
						<li>Completed the Lecturecast “Introduction to Secure Software Development”</li>
						<li>Researched and authored a post for Collaborative Discussion 1 about vulnerabilities caused by using components with known vulnerabilities (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U1-3_Collab_Discussion_1.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 1 and sequence diagram</a>)</li>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_2"><h4>UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>In Unit 2, I continued to explore software development lifecycles and how to integrate security at various stages of development. I also researched ISO/IEC Standard 27000; coincidentally, my company is going through ISO 27001:2018 certification at this time. It’s been beneficial to learn more about this standard, giving me more context into the security controls and practices in the scope of this certification. During this week, our team (“Least Privilege”) began coordinating our schedules and setting up meetings to begin planning our system design activity, due at the end of Unit 6.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 1 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U1-3_Collab_Discussion_1.html" target="_blank">link to question responses</a>)</li>

							</ul>
							<hr />

							<header>
								<a id="unit_3"><h4>Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts &amp; Design</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>In this unit, I learned about the origins, lineages, and characteristics of different programming languages. Though I was familiar with some concepts – polymorphism, inheritance, and abstraction – from previous modules, I was not familiar with assembly languages until this unit. The Codio exercises provided hands-on experiments with buffer overflow scenarios. This was also my first exposure to the C programming language and using linters such as Pylint. These lessons helped drive our team’s discussion about the inherent strengths and weaknesses of various programming languages. We determined that when properly implemented, Python is generally a secure language that helps applications fail elegantly instead of causing a fatal error that crashes a system.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team Activity: Discussed the security of different programming languages (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U3_Team_Assignment.html" target="_blank">link to team activity</a>)</li>
								<li>Team Meeting: Developed secure application concept</li>

								<li>Completed Codio activities: Exploring Python tools and features, and Producer-Consumer Mechanism (link – revisit)</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_4"><h4>Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Unit 4 introduced regular expressions and recursion as two core programming concepts with significant security ramifications. This was particularly interesting, as I learned how a strength of computing – the ability for a machine to quickly do exactly what it’s told – is also a weakness when the instructions are flawed. In addition to the course material, I did some independent research to expand my awareness of “evil regexes” and how to identify them in practice. On Friday, the Least Privilege team met to refine our intended application use cases and began to develop our high-level architecture for the design assignment.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team Meeting: Refined secure application concept, began design process</li>
								<li>Completed programming language concepts activity (link)</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 2 (link)</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_5"><h4>Unit 5: An Introduction to Testing</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This week helped tie many of the testing concepts I have learned in other modules together, and to underscore the purposes of proper testing. Unit 5 reinforced that software quality and vulnerability are tightly coupled and inversely related. Testing during development ultimately produces reliable and efficient software that offers fewer potential vulnerabilities to begin with; on the other end, vulnerability testing looks for flaws from an external perspective once an application or component has been developed. As my ability to understand and develop software matures, my appreciation for efficient and effective testing continues to grow.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team Meeting: continued collaborative work on the design assignment</li>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast "Testing"</li>
								<li>U•	Completed Codio activities: Equivalence Testing in Python, Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today  (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Codio activities</a>)</li>
								<li>Researched and tested UML design applications: SmartDraw, draw.io, Lucidchart</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
						
							<header>
								<a id="unit_6"><h4>Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Over my years of casual programming and exposure to different coding tools, I had never encountered tools known as “linters.” This unit oriented me to linters, and I will certainly incorporate them in my future development efforts going forward. Not only do they improve the quality of code, but linters also help me increase my knowledge of the programming language by identifying an issue (such as an unnecessary “else” statement), pointing me to the location of the issue, and enabling me to check to see if my remedy is effective. During this week, our team also finalised our design document prior to submission.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team Meeting: review combined work product, identify final actions for design assignment </li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 3 (link)</li>
								<li>Completed and submitted the Development Team Project: Design Document (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/First4Aid_Design_Doc.pdf" target="_blank">link to design document</a>)</li>

								<a id="unit_7"><h4>Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>As an avid computer user for more than three decades, I have used a variety of operating systems beginning with Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS), Unix, and the subsequent incarnations of Windows. I currently use Mac OS X, Windows 11, and Linux on a daily basis. Despite my familiarity with operating systems of all shapes and sizes, this unit filled in some of my foundational knowledge gaps about kernels, processes, and how operating systems are designed (or not designed) to provide security at the foundational level.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “Operating System Security”</li>
								<li>Responded to the “What is an Ontology?” assignment (link)</li>
								<li>Completed Codio activities: Exploring a simple Python shell, Developing an API for a Distributed Environment (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to Codio activities</a>)</li>
							</ul>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_8"><h4>Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this week’s lesson, I learned about the application of cryptography via operating systems and Python libraries. Discovering TrueCrypt’s encryption capabilities, questionable origins, and controversial abandonment drove me to investigate other publicly available encryption software. This unit provided a very timely and relevant introduction to Python cryptography libraries, as this will be a cornerstone for our team’s web application. In addition to Python’s existing cryptography library, I researched other options such as BCrypt, PyJWT, and Pycryptodome.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: discussed progress and plan to continue secure application development</li>
								<li>Researched and authored a post for Collaborative Discussion 2 about the TrueCrypt case study (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to summary post 2 and ontology</a>)</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 4 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link</a>)</li>
							</ul>
												
							<header>
								<a id="unit_9"><h4>Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been a topic of personal interest for quite some time. Over the past several years, I have been trying to work with a poorly formed ATOM feed to build a dataset for a machine learning application. This unit taught me some of the API fundamentals I have been missing, and after this course concludes, I am excited to revisit that project. During this week, I also learned more about the Flask framework, building templates using Jinja2 and HTML, and incorporating Object Relational Mapping (ORM) modules such as SQLAlchemy into web applications. Our team has been working very hard on developing our web application this week.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: assessed application progress, reprioritised development actions</li>
								<li>Provided feedback to classmates’ posts for Collaborative Discussion 2 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2 and ontology</a>)</li>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_10"><h4>Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>This unit taught me about the variety and evolution of system architectures. This has been particularly informative since many of the topics du jour – microservice architectures, distributed computing, and containerisation – continue to proliferate in professional fora. This has coincided with the implementation of our team’s application architecture. With the application’s modular components tested and assembled, we have been focussed on moving the components into Docker. This will enable us to run our application in a containerised environment, while simultaneously achieving a microservice architecture between the Flask/HTML front end interface, Python application, and the PostgreSQL back end.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: finalised application development and planned our demonstration</li>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures"</li>
								<li>Reviewed feedback and created a summary post for Collaborative Discussion 2 about the TrueCrypt case study (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/U8-10_Collab_Discussion_2.html" target="_blank">link to summary post 2 and ontology</a>)</li>
								<li>Completed the Faceted Data activity (link)</li>
								<li>Prepared for Seminar 5 (link)</li>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_11"><h4>Unit 11: Future trends in Secure Software Development</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>During this week, our team spent a LOT of time working to finalise our secure web application before the demonstration, testing scenarios, and working through our development backlog to implement new features whilst addressing bugs. We had rolling code reviews throughout the week, two coordination sessions to build and rehearse our presentation, and two more sessions to finalise our code and documentation for submission. I believe our demonstration went well; however, as is the case with all demonstrations, we had a bug on one of our functions because I failed to commit one of the last bug fixes to our repo! Despite this frustration, our team carried on and didn’t let this glitch derail the rest of our briefing. This was a difficult week – but a rewarding one.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Team meeting: Prepared for, and rehearsed, our demonstration brief</li>
								<li>Team meeting: finalised web application documentation and submission requirements</li>
								<li>Demonstrated Team Least Privilege’s First4Aid web application (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link to demonstration brief</a>)</li>
								<li>Finalised and submitted the documentation and code for the First4Aid web application (<a href="https://github.com/Least-Privilege-Team/first4aid_final" target="_blank">link to First4Aid repo</a>)</li>
							</ul>

							<header>
								<a id="unit_12"><h4>Unit 12: The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited</h4></a>
							</header>
						
							<p><strong>Reflection: </strong>Due to the time spent on our secure application assignment during Unit 11, this week was a bit of a catch-up. I read about the microservices and microkernels dispute and discussed some of these concepts with our team to formulate a response to the debate. As a proud Linux user, I have come to enjoy the speed and efficiency of that operating system; however, I certainly see the merits for a microkernel architecture. Personally, I believe that the benefits of consolidation and distribution are dependent on the technological application: will the impending era of quantum computing breathe new life into monolithic kernels?</p>
							<p>I have spent a lot of time reflecting upon this course – not only for the sake of my reflective assignment, but because this has been the most engrossing and challenging module to date. Through the long hours, myriad frustrations getting WTForms and SQLAlchemy to cooperate, and gut-wrenching realisation that failures in application development are only the fault of the developer, I was part of a talented team who ceaselessly supported each other.</p>
							<ul>
								<i>Activities Performed:</i>
								<li>Completed the Lecturecast “Future Trends”</li>
								<li>Completed the e-Portfolio compilation, components, and web design</li>
								<li>Completed the final module reflective writing assignment (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/Final_Reflective_Assignment.pdf" target="_blank">link to reflective writing assignment</a>)</li>
							  	<li>Prepared for Seminar 6 (<a href="../SSD/Artefacts/" target="_blank">link</a>)</li>
