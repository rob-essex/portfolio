<p>I used PyJWT in conjunction with the HS256 algorithm to create a password reset token, which we have incorporated into our First4Aid application. The code follows below.</p>

<h3>Why did you select the algorithm you chose?</h3>
<p>HS256 is a symmetric encryption algorithm known for its speed and efficiency, whilst simultaneously providing ample security through the SHA-256 hash algorithm (Johnson, 2022).</p>
<h3>Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>HS256 satisfies GDPR requirements based on the fact that GDPR Chapter 4, Section 2, Article 32 does prescribe specific standards for encryption – only that personal data must be encrypted, and that system owners must assess the appropriate level of security proportional to the risks of data compromise (European Union, 2016; Proton AG, 2019).</p><br>
