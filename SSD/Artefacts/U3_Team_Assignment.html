<h1>Team Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language?</h1>
</center>
<body>
<h3>1.	What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</h3>
<p>Many languages are prone to issues because the languages haven’t been built with modern issues in mind (Pillai, 2017; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). For example, C is prone to error handling issues, whereas Python has built-in handlers that will stop the program in the event of faulty code (Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). </p>
<p>PHP is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) errors (a type of injection attack). As an early language designed for websites, the functionality did not keep up with the distributed nature of modules and code from open source software libraries (Php.net, 2019; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.)</p>
<p>The general trend is that over time, environments and purposes for language use change. This presents new challenges not anticipated when the languages were originally created.
</p><br>
<h3>2.	Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</h3>
<p>Due to its built-in error handling for many fatal errors and its track record to date, Python could be considered a relatively secure language (Pillai, 2017; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). It is not a perfect solution, and newer languages such as Rust extend Python’s security features even further through enhanced error reporting and memory management (Abiodun, 2022).</p><br>
<h3>3.	Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</h3>
<p>Research indicates that Python is too slow to serve as an operating system language, and that a lower-level language like C would be more effective in this role (Abiodun, 2022). The downfall is that designing an operating system in C would likely require an extraordinary amount of testing to ensure stability and security.</p><br>
