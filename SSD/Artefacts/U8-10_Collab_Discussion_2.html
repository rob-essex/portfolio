<h1>Collaborative Discussion 2: Cryptography case study - TrueCrypt</h1>
<h2>Summary Post</h2></center>
<body>

<p>TrueCrypt provided one of the first widely available, reliable, open-source utilities for drive encryption (Crawford, 2022; Green, 2015). As a result, the technology proliferated despite the authors of the software remaining anonymous, until it was abandoned by its creators in 2014 (Crawford, 2022; Green, 2015; Junestam &amp; Guigo, 2014). The mystery surrounding the authors and the origins of this software eventually triggered a crowd-sourced independent audit of TrueCrypt’s security (Crawford, 2022; Green, 2015).</p>
<p>
An interim audit report was released in 2014, which examined the bootloader and the Windows kernel driver (Junestam & Guigo, 2014). This audit revealed four low-severity and four medium-severity vulnerabilities, but none that appeared to be critically important (Junestam & Guigo, 2014). The audit was completed the next year in 2015, with the second report identifying two high-severity vulnerabilities in addition to two more medium-severity issues (Balducci et al., 2015). These reports reinforce the assumption that the vulnerabilities still exist, today (Green, 2015; TrueCrypt, n.d.).</p>

<p>Personally, I would not recommend TrueCrypt as a viable solution unless 1) there were no alternatives or work-around solutions available, 2) the consequences of not encrypting data far exceeded the risk of not encrypting the data, and 3) that there was a secure way to back-up data outside of TrueCrypt. Against a sophisticated adversary, the vulnerabilities identified may only provide a false sense of security (Balducci et al., 2015; Crawford, 2022; Junestam &amp; Guigo, 2014).</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are several open-source alternatives to TrueCrypt that are still supported by the developer community, such as VeraCrypt – based on the last stable release of TrueCrypt (Crawford, 2022; VeraCrypt, n.d.). Classmate Marianne Manaog reinforced this point by noting several strengths of VeraCrypt (Manaog, 2022). Classmate Grzegorz Pikus opined that the emergence of VeraCrypt may have also contributed to the abandonment of support for TrueCrypt (Pikus, 2022).</p><br>
