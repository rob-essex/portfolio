<body>

<p>Cyclomatic complexity, as introduced by Thomas J. McCabe, serves as a method to measure the complexity of an application by counting the number of possible paths through a program (McCabe, 1975; Tornhill, n.d.). This concept can help developers implement the most efficient logic possible; however, it fails to accommodate more complex application designs that contain non-linear logic structures that – according to cyclomatic complexity – would be classified as infinitely complex (Shepperd, 1988; Tornhill, n.d.).</p>

<p>Cyclomatic complexity can be a useful metric when used and interpreted in the context of the target application; however, developers must understand its limitations (Heddings, 2021).</p><br>
