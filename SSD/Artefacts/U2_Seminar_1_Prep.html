<p>The following terms from ISO are particularly relevant to managing cyber security attacks from inside a system or organisation (ISO, 2019):</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Access control – “means to ensure that access to assets is authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements” (ISO, 2019)</li>
	<li>Audit – “systematic, independent and documented process…for obtaining audit evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which the audit criteria are fulfilled” (ISO, 2019)</li>
	<li>Information Security – “preservation of confidentiality…, integrity…and availability…of information” (ISO, 2019)</li>
	<li>Risk – “effect of uncertainty on objectives” (ISO, 2019)</li>
	<li>Threat – “potential cause of an unwanted incident, which can result in harm to a system or organization” (ISO, 2019)</li>
	</ul>
<p>
Information security serves as the over-arching goal for implementing policies, processes, and controls in a given system (ISO, 2019). Access controls serve to prevent unauthorised access to information or system features, thus mitigating risks of undesirable actions on the target system (ISO, 2019). Threats – in terms of intentional or unintentional human actors – may perform unauthorised actions with information, and thus, violating information security policies (ISO, 2019). Audits are used to ensure that security events have not occurred; conversely, if they have occurred, an audit is the first step to incident response and future mitigation (ISO, 2019).</p>
	
<p>Mitigating human threats requires a robust approach that begins outside of the software environment (Garbars, 2002). Users must be properly vetted in accordance with the type of data they may access, and system access should be strictly limited to “need-to-know” information and the lowest privileges required for their role (Garbars, 2002). Additionally, users must be educated in the proper security practices to prevent unsafe practices such as the safe use of passwords, securely viewing websites, not downloading unauthorised applications,  physically securing their workstations, and being aware of potential unauthorised users trying to gain system access (Garbars, 2002).</p><br>
