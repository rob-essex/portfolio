<p>Faceted data has potential to mitigate data leakage in systems by positively identifying, and controlling the flow of, sensitive information (Schmitz et al., 2016). This approach promises better information security; however, this solution will increase the complexity of data systems (Schmitz et al., 2016).</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this application has useful purposes in high security environments where developers are experienced with faceted data implementation. However, applying a faceted data solution requires a thorough understanding of the data, itself (Schmitz et al., 2016). Consequently, this requires greater integration between developers, policymakers, and data stakeholders who understand how data should be available in a system.</p><br>
