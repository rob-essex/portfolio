<p>In 2017, OWASP rated “Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities” as its ninth most significant weakness; in the 2021, this weakness was elevated to the sixth position and renamed “Vulnerable and Outdated Components” to reflect a broader threat within this category (MITRE, 2018; OWASP, 2021b). Furthermore, OWASP’s Top 10 Community Survey cited this issue as the second worst weakness in the field, fueled by the sustained growth of open source and third-party components in software development (Armerding, 2019; OWASP, 2021a). A prime example of hackers exploiting such a vulnerability occurred in 2017, when credit reporting firm Equifax suffered a breach impacting 143 million customers’ data (Brewster, 2017). Equifax’s implementation of Apache Struts had not been updated to fix a vulnerability with a Java parser, despite the fact that a patch had been released several months before (Armerding, 2019; Brewster, 2017).</p>

Unified Modeling Language (UML) Sequence Diagrams show interactions between objects, their sequential order, and activation of those objects (Bell, 2004). This construct depicts the causational relationships between actions: as Developers build complex systems without maintaining a software component inventory, those components may become obsolete or vulnerable to attack (Armerding, 2019). Attackers then conduct reconnaissance operations to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities (Armerding, 2019; OWASP, 2021b). As developers continue to develop and enhance systems without properly inventorying and updating software components, the number of vulnerabilities continues to grow – facilitating future reconnaissance and attack cycles.</p>

<p>Dr. Peoples commented that this description and diagram effectively conveyed this pattern (Peoples, 2022). Marianne discussed the merits of having an organizational approval process for the use of open-source software, and how companies should maintain tools and systems to track use of open source libraries to mitigate vulnerabilities such as Log4j (Manaog, 2022).</p><br>
