	<h3>Unit 3: Buffer Overflow in C, Buffer Overflow in Python</h3>
<p>Activity demonstrated classic buffer overflow in C, and then in Python. This was also my first exposure to Pylint. Overflow.py was rated as "0.00/10." Performed remediation to achieve 10/10 rating.</p>

<h3>Unit 5: Testing in Python</h3>
<p>Applied linters to check for code abnormalities and also performed remedial action remediate and implement functions included in the provided python files. Used pylint, flake8, and mccabe to detect issues with test py files. I found pylint to be the most useful and effective since it gives feedback even if there are not issues found; flake8 simply responds with no feedback if there are no issues. Mccabe failed to run properly in the Codio environment, but running it locally allowed me to quickly assess the complexity of my Python projects.</p>

<h3>Unit 7:  Producer/Consumer</h3>
<p><strong>How is the queue data structure used to achieve the purpose of the code? </strong><br>
	Creates a first-in/first-out queue</p>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of q.put(I)? </strong>Puts an item into the queue; in this case, 100 items</p>
<p><strong>What is achieved by q.get()? </strong>Removes and returns an item from the queue (similar to 'pop')</p>
<p><strong>Extend this producer-consumer code to make the producer-consumer scenario available in a secure way. What technique(s) would be appropriate to apply?  </strong>Requiring a log-in, encrypting queue entries</p>
