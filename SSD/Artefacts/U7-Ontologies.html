<h1>What is an Ontology?</h1></center>
<body>

<p>The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Ontology presented in Unit 7 provides various technical and non-technical audiences with an understanding of how objects in SOA relate to each other (Opengroup.org, n.d.). Our team implemented a similar approach through our system’s class diagram, which is essentially an ontology with additional information regarding class names and data types.</p>

<p>Cyclomatic complexity can be a useful metric when used and interpreted in the context of the target application; however, developers must understand its limitations (Heddings, 2021).</p><br>
